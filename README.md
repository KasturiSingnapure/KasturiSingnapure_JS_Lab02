The quiz application is a simple web-based interactive tool designed to present a series of questions to users. 
Each question is accompanied by four answer options. Users can select an answer for each question, and upon selection, the application checks if the chosen option is correct.
The user's score accumulates based on the number of correct answers. 
After all questions have been answered, the application displays the user's total score and the percentage of correctly answered questions out of the total questions presented. 
The application utilizes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create an engaging and interactive user experience.
